            <p id="aboutMeP"> My name is Jay-Ann Bravo-Harriott. Recently I joined the BlackCodher Bootcamp and have been working towards becoming a full stack developer. <br><br> So far I have experience in HTML, CSS and Javascript. <br><br> Before coding I was a former international basketball player who represented Great Britain and played professionally in Spain. I am currently studying a Masters degree in Marketing alonsgide working in a media internship for a professional basketball team in the UK. <br><br>Over the years, the idea of getting involved in coding and web development crossed my mind but I never knew where to start. The tech industry continues to grow and offers amazing opportunities. Fortunately, Black Codher has enabled me to get closer to reaching those opportunities.  </p>
